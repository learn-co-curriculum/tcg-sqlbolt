# SQLBolt

## Learning Goals

Practice SQL with an interactive tutorial

## Introduction

Visit https://sqlbolt.com/ to start the tutorials.

The lessons start with the fundamentals of SQL and move through the basics to more complicated queries and theory. 

In total, the tutorial should take about 3 hours to complete. Add a few blocks to your calendar to focus just on SQLBolt, and close those other browser tabs! It'll be way more than 3 hours if you're also answering email ;)
